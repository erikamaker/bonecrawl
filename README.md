In 2003, my mom linked me to a .zip file of some text adventures. Just one link is all it took; I spent the rest of my youth on adventures that unfolded before me in terminal-green characters across a curved black screen. For many years, I dreamed of building my own text adventure game and, in 2019, I broke ground on the rogue-like realization of its engine. Here it is, warts and all! 

The idea was to make a more replayable text adventure, that felt less like multiple choice selection, and more like an action RPG. Features: NSWE navigation, a visual grid map of coordinates, health bar display, many objects ranging from tools to NPCs, turn-based battling, inventory management, magick, cooking, crafting, dynamic terrain, environmental puzzles, and a heck of a lot more. 

This engine and POC demo level is nearing completion for desktop. To follow: website, mobile app, and accessibility options. I would love to see this work as an MMORPG (especially for mobile), and I'm planning to make monthly adventures on a subscription basis. If you're interested in collaborating either with code or content, please reach out!

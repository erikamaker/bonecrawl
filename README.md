This is a CLI rogue-like text adventure engine that I've been working on since September, 2019. The idea was to make a more replayable text adventure, that felt less like multiple choice selection, and more like an action RPG. Features NSWE navigation, a visual map of coordinates, health bar display, many objects ranging from tools to NPCs, turn-based battling, functional inventory, magick, cooking, crafting, dynamic terrain, environmental puzzles, and a heck of a lot more. 

This project's engine is nearling completion for desktop terminals. To follow: website, mobile app, and accessibility options. If you're interested in collaborating, please reach out!

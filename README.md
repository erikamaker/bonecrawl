# THE STORY SO FAR

You wake up in your dungeon cell, already dead. A captive soul of the labyrinthian underworld, your fate is eternal torture at the hands of monstrous demons. Except, you don't belong here, and neither does your sister. Somewhere in the 9 treacherous levels, she waits for you. Face your demons, find the family bones, and climb out of perdition. With some sacrifices and a little magick, you may escape.



# ABOUT THE ENGINE 

The idea was to create a text-based RPG that felt action-oriented. It needed to work with words alone, yet stay far away from the realm of multiple-choice CYOAs to maximize on replayability. I wanted the player to experience a full and unique adventure, complete with NSWE navigation, a visual grid map of coordinates, a hearts bar display, inventory management, item crafting, turn-based battling, magick casting, dynamic characters, environmental puzzles, and a heck of a lot more. I don't know that I'll ever complete this project, because I always plan on adding more content. 

If you're interested in collaborating (either in code or content), please reach out!



# ABOUT THE AUTHOR

In 2003, my mom linked me to a .zip file of some text adventures. That's all it took. Very shy, I spent a lot of my youth on solo adventures that unfolded before me in terminal-green characters across a curved black screen. For 20 years, I've dreamed of building my own adventure and, in 2019, I broke ground on the rogue-like realization of its engine. Here it is, warts and all.



# PROGRESS UPDATE

The terminal-based engine is nearing completion, but there's still work to do. Following its completion, I will be building a website at www.bonecrawl.com, where players may can a demo and download the game. Each level will be released in installments. I would love to one day add MMORPG functionality, so that friends can meet up in their own levels to map out adventures. More than anything, I have big mobile app aspirations for this project.

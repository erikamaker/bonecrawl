# THE STORY SO FAR

You wake up alone in your prison cell, already dead. You're a captive soul in the underworld, hunted by nameless monsters and demons sent to torture you for eternity. Except, you don't belong here, and neither does your little sister. Somewhere in the 9 treacherous levels, she's imprisoned. Face your demons, take back the family bones, and climb your way out of perdition. With some sacrifices and a little magick, you may escape.



# ABOUT THE ENGINE 

The idea was to create a text-based RPG that felt action-oriented. It needed to work with words alone, yet stay far away from the realm of multiple-choice. I wanted the player to experience a full adventure, complete with NSWE navigation, a visual grid map of coordinates, a hearts bar display, inventory management, item crafting, turn-based battling, magick casting, dynamic characters, environmental puzzles, and a heck of a lot more. I don't know that I'll ever complete this project, because I always plan on adding more. 



# ABOUT THE AUTHOR

In 2003, my mom linked me to a .zip file of some text adventures. Just one link is all it took; I spent the rest of my youth on adventures that unfolded before me in terminal-green characters across a curved black screen. For many years, I dreamed of building my own text adventure game and, in 2019, I broke ground on the rogue-like realization of its engine. Here it is, warts and all! If you're interested in collaborating (either in code or content), please reach out! 



# PROGRESS UPDATE

The terminal-based engine is nearing completion, but there's still a lot of legwork to do. After its completion, I will be building a website at www.bonecrawl.com, where players may run a demo and download the game. I would love to one day add MMORPG functionality, so that friends can meet up in their own levels to map out new adventures. More than anything, I have big mobile app aspirations for this project.

In 2003, my mom linked me to a .zip file of some text adventures, a genre I've held close to my heart since. For many years, I've dreamed of building my own text adventure game, and in 2019, I broke ground on a CLI rogue-like realization of its engine. 

The idea was to make a more replayable text adventure, that felt less like multiple choice selection, and more like an action RPG. Features: NSWE navigation, a visual map of coordinates, health bar display, many objects ranging from tools to NPCs, turn-based battling, inventory management, magick, cooking, crafting, dynamic terrain, environmental puzzles, and a heck of a lot more. 

This engine and POC demo level is nearling completion for desktop terminal. To follow: website, mobile app, and accessibility options. If you're interested in collaborating, please reach out!

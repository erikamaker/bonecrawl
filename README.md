# THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE

You wake up in a dim dungeon, dead. A prisoner of the sprawling underworld, your eternal fate is demonic torture. Except, you don't belong here.
Fight through the nine labyrinthian levels of perdition. Face treacherous demons, reclaim your bones, and save your soul.


# ABOUT THE ENGINE 

The idea was to create a text-based RPG that felt action-oriented. It needed to work with words alone, yet stay far away from the realm of multiple-choice CYOAs to maximize on replayability. I wanted the player to experience a full and unique adventure, complete with NSWE navigation, a visual grid map of coordinates, a hearts bar display, inventory management, dynamic terrain, tools and weapons crafting, turn-based battling, layered lore, magick casting, reactive characters, environmental puzzles, and a heck of a lot more. 

I don't know that I'll ever complete this project, because I always plan on adding more content. If you're interested in collaborating (either in code or content), please reach out!



# ABOUT THE AUTHOR

In 2003, my mom linked me to a .zip file of some text adventures. That's all it took. Very shy, I spent a lot of my youth on solo adventures that unfolded before me in terminal-green characters across a curved black screen. For 20 years, I've dreamt of building my own adventure and, in 2019, I broke ground on the rogue-like realization of its engine. Here it is, warts and all.



# PROGRESS UPDATE

> I've been polishing some old classes and building the battling methods. NPC class is pretty much finished. Battling is coming along well! I just need to implement special stats to keep things a little more interesting. Coming down the line is: complete battling system including special stats items / attacks, crafting system (really simple idea in mind, shouldn't take long), and then some level building before release! 

Oh, and the engine doesn't scroll anymore. I worked an escape sequence into the main loop that closes the old frame before its successor displays. Lots of small cosmetic tweaks the last month.

> Getting really close to the end for a complete demo and test level. Just need to work on the NPC class, and the crafting system a little more. I've been distracted with work, studying, and the melting of Midwestern snow. I expect a surge of inspiration any day now, and I'll get a webpage ready on bonecrawl.com.

> The terminal-based engine is nearing completion, but there's still work to do. Following its completion, I will be building a website at www.bonecrawl.com, where players may can a demo and download the game. Each level will be released in installments. I would love to one day add MMORPG functionality, so that friends can meet up in their own levels to map out adventures. More than anything, I have big mobile app aspirations for this project.
